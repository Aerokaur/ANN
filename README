## ANN: Approximate Nearest Neighbors

ANN is a library written in the C++ programming language to support both
exact and approximate nearest neighbor searching in spaces of various
dimensions.  It was implemented by David M. Mount of the University of
Maryland, and Sunil Arya of the Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology.  ANN (pronounced like the name \`\`Ann'') stands for
Approximate Nearest Neighbors.  ANN is also a testbed containing
programs and procedures for generating data sets, collecting and
analyzing statistics on the performance of nearest neighbor algorithms
and data structures, and visualizing the geometric structure of these
data structures.

The ANN source code and documentation is available from the following
web page:

For more information on ANN and its use, see the \`\`ANN Programming
Manual,'' which is provided with the software distribution.
